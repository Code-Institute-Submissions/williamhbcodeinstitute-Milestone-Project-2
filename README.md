#Milestone Project 2 - Travel Package Website

##UX
_____

This website has been designed for people contemplating a holiday to Vietnam. 
I wanted to show this clearly through the use of Google maps. I did this by accessing Google maps API's 
to clearly display a map on the page with pre-designated markers for the customer to see where their vacation would take them. I also accessed Google Maps Places so the customer could also use the search box to view any place on the map including restaurants and hotels.

##Features
____________

1. index.html: In this file you will find a basic navigation bar followed by an interactive google maps section. Using Javascript I placed markers across
the map with added info boxes, to give the user information about the individual locations when hovered over them. I used material from the 'Google Maps Platfrom',
link : **https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial. On this website I had to create my own API key to be able to use the data from Google Maps. The maps functions includes a search box
that allows you to search for any hotel or restaurant by typing it into the box.
The final part of my page includes a footer section with contact information and buttons that link to social media websites which have been tested and all function.

##Technologies Used
____________________

For this project I used four languages which include - HTML, CSS, SASS and Javascript. Libraries used
are from Bootstrap and Google Maps Platfrom.

##Testing
___________

To test that the google maps worked properly I used these steps and so should the user:

1. Google Maps:

i. Start by clicking on any of the marker clusters displayed on the map.
ii. Once clicked it will take your closer the marker destinations as tightly grouped markers are better displayed in clusters.
iii. As you get closer the cities you can hover over the markers indicated to make an info box with content about the location shown.
iiii. Also once zoomed into the location you can then use the search box to find hotels or restaurants simply by typing in the name or you can just type 'hotels' to find every hotel in the area / same with restaurants.
iV. To reset and find another location the user can can click the plus or minus simbols found in the bottom right hand corner of the map.

2. Nav Bar:

i. Clicking on 'Contacts' will take you to the footer section where all contact information is displayed. 
ii. The social links buttons will forward the user to the homepages of the designated sites such as - 'www.facebook.com'.
